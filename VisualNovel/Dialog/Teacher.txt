Sorry TODD but I gotta get to class.

[?TODD?]
Sure thing kid. Ya got goooooood rhythm.

[ENVIRONMENT]
You arrive at class and students seem to be pouring out of the classroom. You walk in to see what is happening.

[PLAYER]
Sorry I’m a little bit late but what are we doing now professor?

[TEACHER]
Oh are you {player}.
Why weren’t you here today!!!?!

[PLAYER]
What do you mean I’m here now, I got stuck in the elevator you se-

[TEACHER]
What matters now is that the first day of class is done, and you have homework to do.

[PLAYER]
Class is done!!!?!

[TEACHER]
Yes why else would my class be leaving; The bell doesn’t dismiss you, I do.

[UNKNOWN CHARACTER*MEET LATER]
C’mon, professor. We’re not in high school.

[TEACHER]
All the more reason to discipline you kids. 

[ENVIRONMENT]
You quickly write down the homework from the first day:
*Meet 5 people from your class and have them sign your paper.*

[TEACHER]
Most of the class got their homework done in class, remember to have it signed and ready for tomorrow.

[ENVIRONMENT]
You walk outside and no-one is in sight, everyone has left.

[PLAYER]
Ohhhh maan, how am I gonna get these signatures?
If everyone has already done the assignment they won’t want to talk to me?
Although this could be a good way to meet people for the battle of the bands maybe?!
