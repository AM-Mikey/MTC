[JANITOR]
[ELEVATOR]
After jamming out with the janitor for a long time the elevator finally gets fixed.

[PLAYER]
Sorry mr. janitor but I gotta get to class.

[JANITOR]
Sure thing kid. Ya got goooooood rhythm.

[JANITOR]
[ENVIRONMENT]
You arrive at class and students seem to be pouring out of the classroom. You walk in to see what is happening.

[PLAYER]
Sorry I’m a little bit late but what are we doing now professor?

[TEACHER]
Oh are you {player}. Why weren’t you here today!!!?!

[PLAYER]
What do you mean I’m here now, I got stuck in the elevator you se-

[TEACHER]
What matters now is that the first day of class is done, and you have homework to do.

[PLAYER]
Class is done!!!?!

[TEACHER]
Yes. why else would my class be leaving; The bell doesn’t dismiss you, I do.

[???]
C’mon, professor. We’re not in high school.

[TEACHER]
All the more reason to discipline you kids. 

[ENVIRONMENT]
You quickly write down the homework from the first day: Meet 5 people from your class and have them sign your paper.

[TEACHER]
Most of the class got their homework done in class, remember to have it signed and ready for tomorrow.

[ENVIRONMENT]
You walk outside the classroom into the hall,  and no-one is in sight, everyone has left.

[PLAYER]
Ohhhh maan, how am I gonna get these signatures? If everyone has already done the assignment they won’t want to talk to me? Although this could be a good way to meet some people for the battle of the bands maybe?!

[PLAYER]
Well maybe some of the students from class are still around here somewhere. Surely not everyone has completely cleared out.

[ENVIRONMENT]
The player leaves the lecture building onto the same campus quad as before. Loads of students are walking around the campus, and some are lounging on the grass and benches.

[PLAYER]
Alright. Who can I get to sign my paper? I don’t know if any of these people are in my class.

[ENVIRONMENT]
The background focuses on a character on a bench using a laptop with headphones on. The girl who talked to the professor after class ended.


[PLAYER]
Hey, I know her. She told off the professor earlier. I should ask her to sign my paper and I should probably say thanks.

[ENVIRONMENT]
The background changes to a closer image and the cosplayer is shown in greater detail than before.

[PLAYER]
(Oh my gosh, this is the first person I’m going to meet in college. I’m so nervous.)

[PLAYER]
Hey! How's it going?

[ANNIE]
I’m doing pretty good. How ‘bout yourself

[PLAYER]
My first day’s been pretty rough so far. Thanks for nosing off to the professor earlier

[ANNIE]
Oh, my pleasure. That guy’s a jerk. This one time, he made everyone write an apology to him for not doing the homework, but it only happened because he forgot to post it.

[PLAYER]
Sounds like a nightmare.

[ANNIE]
A nightmare you are now living in. What’d you come in late for, anyway?

[PLAYER]
It’s kind of a long story. Would you mind signing my paper for the homework?

[ANNIE]
Sure, just as long as I can get yours. Here, sit down.

[PLAYER]
Hey, I love what you’re wearing.

[ANNIE]
Thanks. It's what my favorite anime character wears.

[PLAYER]
Why do you dress like them?

[ANNIE]
I just really admire how heroic she is.

[PLAYER]
Well it looks cool.

[SCENE TEXT]
While the cosplayer is signing your notebook, you see that she has some kind of music software open on her computer.

[PLAYER]
Do you make music?

[ANNIE]
I do, but it’s just kind of a hobby

[PLAYER]
Mind if I take a listen?

[ANNIE]
sure, let me turn it up
